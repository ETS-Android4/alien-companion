# Alien Companion for reddit

**Important notes:** No longer maintained. This app was developed back in 2015 as a learning and passion project. Over the course of development I have acquired a lot of
knowledge and became familiar with Java and the Android SDK. Because this started as my first attempt at developing and maintaining an application of this scale, you
will encounter some bad practices and design mistakes if you take a look at the source. Also, Android development has evolved drastically since I first started learning
therefore I strongly advise against using the code in this repo if you're trying to learn.
